                  <p>The materials reviewed in this bibliography have been carefully selected as a sampling of resources covering a wide range
                     of genres, methods, perspectives, and literary traditions in digital literary studies. Limited to resources in English, these
                     have been chosen because each resource is freely available online with few or no areas of restricted access and represents
                     best practices reflecting time-honored scholarly traditions and current digital standards. In particular, each resource:
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p> <b>•</b> contains rich, multi-layered content that is current and has been thoroughly referenced and vetted by the creators and/or
                     the appropriate scholarly community;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p> <b>•</b> clearly reflects a guiding principle or theory that is in keeping with current standards of scholarly literary practice (both
                     traditional and digital);
                  </p>
                  
                  <p> <b>•</b> uses the digital medium to facilitate a discovery-based, synthesized experience with its content, above and beyond providing
                     access to digitized texts or a compilation of resources. These resources are <i>essentially</i> digital: each, at some level, engages with literature in ways not possible before the digital age.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>This annotated overview is divided into three main sections based on content: Digital Transcriptions and Images; Born-Digital
                     Texts and New Media Objects; and Criticism, Reviews, and Tools.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-6-13_h1"></a><h2 class="normal">Digital Transcriptions and Images</h2>
                  
                  <p>One of the primary goals of digital literary resources has been to provide access to large bodies of related texts in a systematic
                     way. In addition to providing access to digital transcriptions and images, the digital research archives included here present
                     edited and encoded texts, contextual essays, and tools that help users discover new texts or make new connections within and
                     between familiar ones. The exemplary nature of all these resources is reflected in the way that they examine or expose the
                     differences in the very nature of analog and digital resources and research.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>One key feature shared by some of these resources is a unique interface for discovery and analysis of the comprised materials.
                     For example, many resources allow for easy navigation through side-by-side comparisons of text, multimedia objects, translations,
                     commentary, and notes. Among the resources that have emphasized alternative viewing choices are <i>The Rossetti Archive</i>, <i>Princeton Dante Project</i>, <i>Internet Shakespeare Editions</i>, and <i>Hap Hazard</i>. In addition to reading interfaces, some projects offer advanced searching capabilities that are designed around textual
                     features (<i>The Rossetti Archive</i>, <i>Princeton Dante Project</i>, <i>The Blake Archive</i>). Still other resources emphasize the physical organization of the original work through hypertext navigation as in <i>The Early Stuart Libels</i> and <i>The Electronic Edition of John Ruskin's Modern Painters I</i>.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The resources listed here also emphasize the means by which the digital medium may be used to convey particular interpretations
                     of text in novel ways. Both <i>Mark Twain In His Times</i> and <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin &amp; American Culture: A Multimedia Archive</i> underscore a particular "interpretive" stance through interactive exhibits. These features highlight key themes such as the cultural impact of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> on race relations and book publishing or how the persona of "Mark Twain" was "created and defined, marketed and performed, reviewed and appreciated." In <i>The Thomas MacGreevy Archive</i> interpretation is guided through the "Browse" menu through which a user may explore "the life, writings, and relationships" of the author with and beyond his published texts through various media and from different perspectives. Other resources
                     combine different types of materials to build a fuller context for their research. Resources such as <i>The Decameron Web</i>, <i>The Walt Whitman Archive</i>, and <i>Jónas Hallgrímsson: Selected Poetry and Prose</i> are not limited to primary texts; these combine textual, visual, and audio features to facilitate the exploration of the
                     life and works of their subjects.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Many of these resources explicitly address the digital scholarly community through research articles, scholarly tools, and
                     forums for scholarly discussion. From the "samplers" of the <i>Dickinson Electronic Archives</i> — digital articles that serve as examples of "what can be accomplished when shaping critical arguments via new media" — to the extensive documentation of editorial choices, digital design, and tools for literary analysis in <i>The Blake Archive</i> to the robust suite of user-oriented features in <i>Romantic Circles</i> (including a weblog and MOO alongside more traditional outlets for scholarly discussion), these resources not only provide
                     access to primary materials but serve as an outlet for shaping the discipline through scholarly debate, presentation of research,
                     and the establishment of practices and methods.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Finally, many of these resources bring together different communities in a new collaborative scholarly space. Literary scholars
                     and libraries have long collaborated to provide easily accessible and thoughtfully collected resources to the larger community
                     (<i>The Library of Southern Literature</i>, <i>British Women Romantic Poets</i>, and <i>Beowulf: A New Translation for Oral Delivery</i>). Other new bonds are being forged between traditional academic — the Early English Texts Society (EETS) — and digital literature communities through resources like <i>Ancrene Wisse Preface</i>. Likewise, <i>The Diary of Samuel Pepys</i> is an innovative weblog-based re-creation of the 1660 text that reflects a collective work-in-progress in which regular user
                     comments provide for historical context and editorial analysis.

                     poets reading Dickinson's work, other secondary scholarly materials, and a discussion space.

                  <p>As diversified as any genre of literary works, the "born-digital" resources included here take on an amalgamation of various programming languages and electronic forms presented in a variety
                     of digital environments. All of these resources are currently in use and include recent additions by the editors and authors.
                     Some of the material associated with each entry is archived on the listed URL and some is linked from the site, but all of
                     these resources function as thoughtful representations of a particular perspective or artist of digital media and literature.
                     For example, some entries function much like literary journals and are associated with various works and artists. <i>Arras</i>, Brian Kim Stefans's contribution to new media poetry and poetics, is "devoted to exploring how digital technology has impacted the field of experimental poetics"; <i>blackice</i> showcases work "modeled after the great avant-garde literary writing of past" by "publishing some of the most offensive, sexy, and formally adventurous writing of the last fifteen years"; and the <i>Electronic Literature Organization</i> (ELO) is committed to providing access to a wealth of archived electronic literature and also to the Preservation, Archiving,
                     and Dissemination (PAD) project (which seeks to "maintain accessibility, encourage stability, and ensure availability of electronic works" for future readers).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Other entries function as author sites that archive, link to, and comment on pieces by particular authors whose works have
                     helped elevate digital literature to its current status as a well-regarded literary genre. Deena Larsen, Shelley Jackson,
                     Stuart Moulthrop, M. D. Coverley, and Mark Amerika represent some "first wave" electronic literature with hypertext pieces such as Amerika's <i>Grammatron</i>, Jackson's "My Body," Larsen's "Disappearing Rain," Moulthrop's award-winning <i>hegirascope</i>, and Coverley's many pieces of early fiction in now-archived digital journals such as <i>Beehive</i> (&lt;http:// beehive.temporalimage.com/) and subscription-based <i>Web Conjunctions</i> (&lt;http:// www.conjunctions.com/webconj.htm). "Second Wave" electronic literature is represented by the flash pieces of Stefans, Talan Memmott, and Jason Nelson (<i>secrettech-nology</i> and <i>Heliozoa</i>); JavaScript work by Stuart Moulthrop; collaborative new media poems directed by Thomas Swiss; and the game narratives of
                     Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. Other perspectives include John Cayley's work with programmable, digital movies (<i>P</i>=<i>R</i>=<i>O</i>=<i>G</i>=<i>R</i>=<i>A</i>=<i>M</i>=<i>M</i>=<i>A</i>=<i>T</i>=<i>O</i>=<i>L</i>=<i>O</i>=<i>G</i>=<i>Y</i>), Nick Montfort's experiments with interactive fiction, and mez's "mezangelle" texts.

                     poem, and structural works (which explore a structural theme using layout, imagery, words, and navigation). Her works include
                     well-known pieces such as the Flash piece "Firefly" available from the archived site <i>Poems that Go</i> (&lt;<a href="http://www.poemsthatgo.com/">http://www.poemsthatgo.com/</a>&gt;).

                  <p>Winner of the <i>Electronic Literature Organization</i>'s first annual award in digital poetry in 2001, Cayley could be termed the "digital writer's digital writer" for his innovative use of "text movies" which combine literature and programmable technology (such as QuickTime) and his critical work on new media art in his essays
                     "literal art" and "the code is not the text (unless it is the text)." He is also a frequent object of and contributor to scholarly, critical debates on the <i>electronic book review</i>.

                  <p>The following list comprises resources that function in a secondary capacity to the texts presented in the first two sections
                     of this bibliography. The primary goal of these resources is to reflect on, engage with, and explore electronic texts of both
                     transcription-based resources and born-digital literary objects. Many of these resources are sponsored and supported by established
                     digital and literary associations and organizations, such as the Association of Literary Scholars and Critics (<i>The Valve</i>); the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (<i>Digital Humanities Quarterly</i>); the Society for Digital Humanities/Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs (<i>Text Technology</i>; McMaster University), and the PEN American Center (<i>Words Without Borders</i>). Other resources were created and are maintained by other traditional cultural institutions such as the New Museum of Contemporary
                     Art (<i>Rhizome.Org</i>), The New Media Group in English at George Mason University (<i>://English Matters</i>), Universities such as Nottingham Trent University (<i>trAce Online Writing Centre</i>) and the Graduate College and the Department of English at the University of Iowa and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication
                     at the University of Minnesota (<i>The Iowa Review Web</i>). Others (<i>Web Del Sol</i> and Alt-X's <i>electronic book review</i>) were created by "born digital" organizations.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Also included in this section are digital tools which are meant to aid scholarly interpretations of literary texts through
                     the digital medium. Some are built to "crunch" text in the manner of traditional computational linguistics, whether it be through creating co-occurrence and distribution
                     lists with a tool like <i>HyperPo</i> or through determining "morphological, lexical, prosodic, and narratological criteria" with <i>WordHoard</i>. In addition to these functions, <i>TAPoR</i> (Text Analysis Portal for Research) provides a user "workbench" where the user can login, find help documentation about text analysis in general, upload her texts, use a variety of any
                     tool the tool creators have made available to the <i>TAPoR</i> open-source environment, and save work for the next visit. Other types of tools facilitate the user's analysis and display
                     of encoded XML and SGML texts. The resources <i>Juxta</i> and the <i>Versioning Machine</i> allow users to compare, collate, and display variant versions of digital texts while the <i>teiPublisher</i> facilitates the user's ability to create a searchable digital text repository, including metadata ontology development and
                     indexing that may be displayed on the web. Still more tools included in this section include resources that incorporate innovative
                     representations of texts that facilitate interpretive strategies unimaginable in the traditional text environment. The resources
                     include single digital editions that incorporate image comparison (<i>John Lydgate's Fall of Princes</i> and <i>Extracts from the Diary of Robert Graves</i>) and an interactive timeline (<i>Absalom! Absalom!</i>). Other "tools" represented here are analysis tools incorporated into multiple-text archives like GIS plotting in <i>The Perseus Project</i> and an innovative visual interpretation of an entire text on a single screen in <i>TextArc</i>. All of the tools listed here are the creations of well-regarded institutions associated with the highest digital literary
                     standards, traditions, and innovative practices and in many cases source code is also made available.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>All of these sites maintain the goal to respond to, reflect, and engage the digital literary community at large. These resources
                     include commentary on digital literary issues through more formal scholarly critiques and debates (<i>Digital Humanities Quarterly</i>, <i>electronic book review</i>, <i>Grand Text Auto</i>, <i>Postmodern Culture</i>, <i>Text Technology</i>, and <i>the Valve</i>) and informal book reviews and exchanges (<i>trace</i>, <i>Web Del Sol</i>, and <i>Words without Borders</i>). In addition, some of these digital resources have a focus on primary materials usually in the form of electronic literature,
                     interviews, and teaching modules (<i>:// English Matters</i>, <i>The Iowa Review Web</i>, <i>trAce</i>, and <i>Rhizome.org</i>). Beyond presenting and commenting on digital literature, these resources use the digital medium as a platform for exchange,
                     whether the implementation is a weblog (<i>The Valve)</i>, an exhibition or installation (<i>Rhizome.org</i>), or a message board (<i>ebr</i>), and most of these sites use underlying databases and innovative interface designs to augment both the access to and the
                     interaction with their content.

                  <p>This resource, affiliated with the Department of the Classics at Tufts University, focuses on creating tools to facilitate
                     the access to and the presentation and analysis of ancient, classical and Renaissance texts as well as art and architectural
                     images. Some of these tools include word searches, atlas tools for creating maps, tools for morphological analysis and generating
                     tables of contents, and a virtual reality interface.

                  <p>This portal is a gateway to resources and tools "for sophisticated analysis and retrieval, along with representative texts for experimentation." A key feature is a user-interface that allows for uploading, deleting, and storing texts to an individual user account. In
                     addition, users can store settings such as "favorite" tools and text analysis results alongside access to a more global interface that represents the "best practices of experienced computing humanists available to the larger humanities research community." Based at McMaster University, this project comprises a network of six Humanities computing centers in Canada: McMaster, University
                     of Victoria (in collaboration with Malaspina UC), University of Alberta, University of Toronto, Université de Montreal (law) and University of New Brunswick.
