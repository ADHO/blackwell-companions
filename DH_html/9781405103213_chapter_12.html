                  <p>Computing technologies – like other technological innovations in the modern West – are inevitably introduced with the rhetoric of "revolution." Especially during the 1980s (the PC revolution) and 1990s (the Internet and Web revolutions), enthusiasts insistently celebrated
                     radical changes – changes ostensibly inevitable and certainly as radical as those brought about by the invention of the printing press, if
                     not the discovery of fire.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>These enthusiasms now seem very "1990s" – in part as the revolution stumbled with the dot.com failures and the devastating impacts of 9/11. Moreover, as I will sketch out below, the patterns of diffusion and impact in philosophy and religion show both tremendous
                     success, as certain revolutionary promises are indeed kept – as well as (sometimes spectacular) failures. Perhaps we use revolutionary rhetoric less frequently – because the revolution has indeed succeeded: computing technologies, and many of the powers and potentials they bring us
                     as scholars and religionists have become so ubiquitous and <i>normal</i> that they no longer seem "revolutionary" at all. At the same time, many of the early hopes and promises – instantiated in such specific projects as Artificial Intelligence and anticipations of virtual religious communities – have been dashed against the apparently intractable limits of even these most remarkable technologies. While these failures
                     are usually forgotten, they leave in their wake a clearer sense of what these new technologies can, and can<i>not</i> do.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>To see this, I highlight historical and current examples of how computing technologies are used in philosophy and religion.
                     We will see that philosophers have been engaged with computing from its beginnings in the dreams of Leibniz in the seventeenth
                     century<a href="#ss1-2-12_fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the earliest implementations of electronic computers in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. And, perhaps because of the clear
                     connections between computing technologies and a range of classical philosophical practices (logic) and fields (epistemology,
                     ontology, ethics, political philosophy, etc.), computation has enjoyed an increasingly central place in the philosophical
                     literature of the past fifty years. Indeed, many philosophers speak of a "computational turn" – referring to ways in which computing technologies have given philosophers new kinds of laboratories for testing and refining
                     classical debates and hypotheses.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Similarly, religious studies scholars learned early to exploit the new tools – beginning with Father Roberto Busa's pioneering use of computers in the 1940s to analyze complex texts. More sophisticated
                     versions of these early innovations gradually developed and became commonplace on today's desktops and even palm-held computers.
                     In addition, the impact of computation in religion seems still more powerful in the larger domain of religious practice. In
                     ways consistent with earlier technological innovations – especially such mass media as the radio and television – it is especially the religiously marginalized and proselytizers who have benefited from computation as instantiated in computer
                     networks, i.e., the Internet and the World Wide Web.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In both domains we will see the same general pattern: an early period of enthusiasm, one that rode high on revolutionary – even apocalyptic – promises of radical transformation, followed by a quieter period of diffusion and incorporation of computing technologies
                     within philosophical and religious domains. Hegel would remind us that it is in this relative quiet, aided now by a rich history
                     of examples, that we are able to evaluate more critically and carefully the strengths and limits of these remarkable technologies.

                  <a name="ss1-2-12_h2"></a><h3 class="normal">The computational turn: logic, AI, ethics</h3>
                  
                  <p>Arguably, computing <i>is</i> philosophy – specifically, the branch of philosophy concerned with logic. Our computing devices depend on the logical system developed
                     by George Boole in the 1840s and 1850s; prior to Boole, a number of philosophers in the modern era – most notably, Leibniz – concerned themselves with the possibilities of machines that might automate reasoning as the manipulation of symbols (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b15">Dipert 2002</a>: 148). Hence, it is perhaps not surprising that some of the earliest applications of computing technology in philosophy were
                     precisely in the area of logic – in efforts both to exploit the computer as a logical calculating device (e.g., for assessing argument validity and generating
                     valid conclusions from specified premises; ibid.) as well as to automate the teaching of logic (perhaps most notably by Patrick
                     Suppes, beginning in 1963: see Suppes, Home page).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Moreover, as computers automate and expand our ability to undertake logical analyses, they not only offer new ways of accomplishing
                     classical logical tasks (from truth-table analysis through proofs to advanced logical applications – e.g., <i>Tarski's World</i>, etc.: see <a href="#ss1-2-12_b3">Barwise and Etchemendy 1999</a>), they further open up distinctively new ways of exploring classical philosophical questions. One of the earliest, and most
                     obvious, examples of this "computational turn" in philosophy is the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) – the effort to replicate human consciousness and reasoning through computing devices, prominent especially in the 1950s through
                     the early 1990s. Computers provided philosophers with a laboratory in which to empirically test and refine hypotheses about
                     the nature of reason and consciousness. Initially, so-called "hard" AI proponents believed and argued that machines would quickly outstrip human intelligence. It appears, however, that the
                     hard AI agenda has largely moved to the margins – primarily because of repeated failures to live up to early promises. As in the natural sciences, however, both successes
                     and failures are instructive: the successful efforts to instantiate at least some components of human reasoning in machines
                     has helped philosophers sharpen their sense of how far computation and consciousness overlap – while the failures help demarcate how computation and human reasoning remain intractably distinct from one another. Indeed,
                     there is a recent turn in philosophy – in fields as diverse as hermeneutics, phenomenology, and feminism – towards <i>embodiment</i> as a key theme of exploration: philosophers such as Albert Borgmann and Hubert Dreyfus use an understanding of <i>who we are as embodied creatures</i> to explore the strengths and limits of technology, including computing technologies, in contemporary life. In particular,
                     Dreyfus recognizes the (limited) achievements of AI and the (limited) pedagogical advantages of distance learning via the
                     Web and the Internet, but he further argues that these technologies do <i>not</i> help us acquire our most distinctive and important human capacities – those of making commitments, taking risks, and exercising <i>phronesis</i> (Aristotle's term for practical judgment and wisdom) in our ethical and political lives.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Indeed, the creators of modern computing technology have been aware from the outset that these new devices raise, precisely,
                     questions of <i>ethics</i> with regard to the use of these systems, <i>politics</i> with regard to their potential social and political impacts, etc. As Bynum points out (2001), Norbert Wiener, in what amounts
                     to the first book of computer ethics (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b36">Wiener 1950</a>), recognized that computing technologies will impact, for better and for worse, life and health, knowledge and science, work
                     and wealth, creativity and happiness, democracy and freedom, and inter/national concerns with peace and security. In Bynum's view, moreover, Wiener sets the agenda for the field of computer ethics
                     – a field that begins to emerge only slowly in the 1960s and 1970s, but now includes an extensive literature, including the
                     journal <i>Ethics and Information Technology.</i> More broadly, the computational turn is now well documented not only in AI and ethics, but also, for example, in philosophy
                     of mind, philosophy of science, epistemology, ontology, and so forth (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b10">Bynum and Moor 1998</a>, 2003). Indeed, the late 1990s and early twenty-first century saw the emergence of philosophy of information as one way to
                     provide a systematic overview of the impact of computing in virtually every domain of philosophy (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b21">Floridi 2003</a>).
                  </p>
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-12_h3"></a><h3 class="normal">Hypertext</h3>
                  
                  <p>In the 1980s, both philosophers and other humanities scholars were excited by a new form of "non-linear" text made possible by computing technologies – hypertext. While the theoretical reflections and software experiments of such hypertext pioneers as Jay David Bolter and
                     George Landow were most prominent – at least some philosophers were likewise quite interested in the potential of hypertext to open up at least <i>alternative</i> forms of argument. The best known of these, David Kolb, has in fact argued that hypertexts will make possible the <i>recovery</i> of argument forms (e.g., Hegel's dialectic) which are only awkwardly expressed in the (largely) linear frameworks of print.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-12_h4"></a><h3 class="normal">CD-ROM databases (ethics, history of philosophy)</h3>
                  
                  <p>After appearing in the 1980s, CD-ROMs seemed the perfect medium for realizing extensive hypermedia programs and databases.
                     Two examples can be mentioned here. First, effective hypermedia resources have been developed for exploring and teaching ethics
                     (e.g., <a href="#ss1-2-12_b13">Cavalier et al. 1998</a>). These resources are especially useful as they provide video documentary and interviews to bring more abstract discussion
                     of general principles down to the fine-grained contexts of real persons facing specific ethical problems in particular contexts.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Second, while originally defined as a Greek classics project – i.e., focused on collecting primary and secondary literary and historical texts, as well as architectural, historical, and
                     cultural resources (including extensive visual images of important sites, artifacts, etc.) -the second edition of the Perseus
                     Project (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b33">Perseus 2.0 1996</a>) also included both the Greek and English texts of Plato and Aristotle. Like its counterparts in Biblical studies, the Perseus
                     CD-ROM not only provides an electronic library of these primary texts, but also allows for text searches and analyses. For
                     example, I can find – more or less instantly – every example of Plato's use of the term <img src="9781405103213_chapter_12_f1.gif"> ("cybernetes", a steersman, or pilot, and thus figuratively, the Divine as directing the destiny of humans – and the root, not coincidentally, of "cybernetics") as well as related terms. Through hypertext linking, the program can further take me to each example in the Platonic text,
                     as well as provide morphological analyses. Such searches, of course, accomplish in minutes what might otherwise take weeks,
                     months, or years of reading.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>At the same time, however, while these are extraordinary resources and tools, they are also quite limited. While the primary
                     and secondary texts made available on CD-ROM are extensive – and supplemented, of course, by a constantly growing electronic library on the Web – only a relatively small percentage of the literatures important to philosophers has been digitized. Moreover, word searches
                     and morphological analyses are important components of scholarship – but they are only a very small component of our research, reflection, and writing. As with the specific history of AI, philosophers
                     (and, it appears, religion scholars) are gaining a more realistic and nuanced appreciation of the strengths <i>and</i> limits of computing technologies in their disciplines, precisely as the successful resources and tools simultaneously mark
                     out what the technologies <i>cannot</i> do (at least so far).
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-12_h5"></a><h3 class="normal">Computer-mediated communication</h3>
                  
                  <p>The sorts of communication most familiar to us in terms of the Internet and the Web also serve as a philosophical laboratory,
                     one that allows philosophers to revisit classical questions in the domains of ontology, epistemology (including semiotics,
                     hypertext, and logic), the meaning of identity and personhood (including issues of gender and embodiment), and ethical and
                     political values (especially those clustering about the claim that these technologies will issue in a global democracy vs.
                     the correlative dangers of commercialization and a "computer-mediated colonization": see <a href="#ss1-2-12_b19">Ess 2003</a>).
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-12_h6"></a><h3 class="normal">The Internet and the World Wide Web</h3>
                  
                  <p>Interestingly enough, major projects in both philosophy (Perseus) and religious studies (Diana Eck's On Common Ground) that
                     began on CD-ROM have migrated to the Web to join additional "electronic libraries" and online search engines. Two significant examples of online philosophical resources are the <i>Hippias</i> search engine and website, and Lawrence Hinman's <i>Ethics Updates</i> site.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Finally, these computer networks have made possible what is now the presumed environment of philosophical scholarship – namely e-mail, listservs, extensive online databases and search engines, and countless websites (of varying quality) that
                     collect and "publish" (often) significant resources. It is commonly observed that, in contrast with the high-profile projects and experiments,
                     in the end, it is the relatively low-tech tools that make the most difference – in this case, e-mail and listservs. Despite the explosion of scholarly resources and specialized tools available online and
                     on CD-ROM, it remains debatable as to whether the computer revolution has markedly improved philosophical debate, scholarship,
                     or insight (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b15">Dipert 2002</a>). Nonetheless, the ability for scholars, geographically remote from one another and positioned at institutions of varying
                     resources and prestige, to communicate directly with one another through e-mail and listservs organized by interests and specialties
                     is arguably "revolutionary" indeed. At the same time, however, this ability is now a commonplace.

                  <p>While philosophers were closely involved with the development and early uses of computing technologies because of their disciplinary
                     focus on logic, religious scholars were among the first to explore applications of computing in textual analysis. More recently,
                     however – beyond the use of the Web and the Internet by believers and discussants – there appear to be comparatively fewer religiously oriented computing projects (perhaps because religious studies are among
                     the most marginalized and underfunded in the academy?). As a representative example: the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia – arguably one of the most important centers for developing computing-based humanities applications – lists only two projects (out of some fifty or so) that focus on some aspect of religious studies. On the other hand, the
                     open communicative environments of the Internet and the Web, while appropriated in much the same way among religious scholars
                     as among philosophers, by contrast have been taken up with explosive energy by more or less every religious tradition whose
                     representatives enjoy Internet access.

                  <a name="ss1-2-12_h8"></a><h3 class="normal">The use of computing technologies in religious scholarship</h3>
                  
                  <p>In the 1940s, Father Roberto Busa began developing techniques for encoding complex texts in ways that could be manipulated
                     by computers – first of all, to develop a concordance for the corpus of Thomas Aquinas, followed by a more extensive project to develop
                     a hypertextual edition of Aquinas that allowed for multiple levels of linking and comparison <i>(Thomae Aquinatis Opera Omnia cum hypertextibus in CD-ROM).</i> At least one Bible concordance (for the then new <i>Revised Standard Version of the Bible)</i> was also generated in the 1950s using a computer. As computers became (somewhat) less expensive and more widespread through
                     the 1960s and 1970s, religious scholars began to develop ways of exploiting the computer's storage and processing abilities
                     to undertake complex text analyses (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b23">Harbin 1998</a>). Just as philosophers hoped to make the machine take over foundational but repetitive tasks of logical calculation, so their
                     colleagues in religious studies sought to use the machine to take on the tedium of word counts and comparisons.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As microcomputers and CD-ROMs made processing and storage increasingly inexpensive in the 1980s, descendants of these early
                     text-base and concordance projects moved to the desktops and laptops of religious scholars. First of all, Bible database projects
                     flourished – i.e., collections of Bible texts, translations, and commentaries, with basic computing features (indexing, word searches,
                     note-taking) that support both elementary and more advanced sorts of grammatical and textual analysis. These range from the
                     historically oriented <i>History of the English Bible</i> (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b4">Beam and Gagos 1997</a>) to such significant resources as Bible Works. These new technologies further allow other sorts of databases – for example, Diana Eck's <i>On Common Ground</i> CD-ROM and subsequent website that documents religious diversity in the USA.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>On the one hand, these resources fulfill some of the fondest dreams of scholars. BibleWorks, for example, allows for complex
                     searches through multiple Bibles – translations as well as critical editions in Greek and Hebrew. A scholar can accomplish in minutes an inquiry that would
                     otherwise take weeks or months. This is the analogue to the way computing technologies have indeed revolutionized mathematics,
                     the sciences, and logic by turning over to the machine repetitive tasks that would otherwise take humans months, years, and
                     lifetimes to perform (cf. <a href="#ss1-2-12_b24">Hardmeier 2000</a>). On the other hand, as in philosophy, the impact of these new resources and abilities on the quality and quantity of scholarship
                     remains a very open question. In particular, computer-adept scholars observe that these resources exploit only the most basic
                     potentials of the computer, and – echoing the Socratic critique of the technology of writing as leading to the appearance, but not the substance, of wisdom
                     – run the danger of giving the untutored amateur the appearance, if not conviction, that s/he now knows as much as any Bible scholar.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>More fundamentally, the emergence of these new technologies themselves – again, especially as interpreted through the lenses of postmodernism – all but required scholars in religion to consider and respond to what many began to see as the emerging "secondary orality of electronic culture" (so one of the premier theologically oriented theorists of new media: <a href="#ss1-2-12_b32">Walter Ong, 1988</a>: 135–8, cited in <a href="#ss1-2-12_b31">O'Leary and Brasher 1996</a>: 246). In response, the American Bible Society (after bringing out one of the first CD-ROM Bible databases) undertook an
                     ambitious series of projects to "transmediate" important Christian narratives – i.e., to translate these, using scholarly approaches and principles of translation, into the multimedia environments made
                     possible by computing technologies; to synthesize music, visual images, and scholarly resources as an environment for "telling the story" in a way intended to be attractive especially to younger people, who are oriented primarily to electronic visual media (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b1">American Bible Society 1995</a>). Despite considerable investment and remarkable talent, however, these projects have met with only limited success in the
                     religious marketplace.

                  <a name="ss1-2-12_h9"></a><h3 class="normal">Religious scholarship on the Web</h3>
                  
                  <p>As for philosophers, the Internet and the Web have diffused into the commonplace practices and environment of religious scholars.
                     Beyond the explosive development of sites on the Web by diverse faith communities, there is also to be found a reasonably
                     extensive but largely pedestrian use of the Internet and the Web to support
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p> <b>•</b> listservs on scholarly topics of interest to religion scholars and lay persons;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p> <b>•</b> sites for religious studies professionals (e.g., the American Academy of Religion) that offer relatively little in terms of
                     use or pointers towards use of computing technolo gies, but rather make use of the Web – sensibly – as an easily updateable archive for such things as their online syllabus project, etc.; and
                  </p>
                  
                  <p> <b>•</b> portal sites (e.g., Oxford University [<a href="#ss1-2-12_b22">Fraser 2000</a>], the Society of Biblical Literature's <i>Electronic Publications and Technology Resources for Biblical Studies)</i> that list both institu tionally based resources and often very rich and helpful sites put up by individual scholars.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As with philosophers, these now relatively low-tech uses of the computing technology may have the most significance as they
                     expand access to resources and the ability to communicate with geographically distant scholars who share similar interests.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-12_h10"></a><h3 class="normal">The Internet, the Web, and religious communities</h3>
                  
                  <p>Whatever the potentials and impacts of computing technologies for religious scholars, religious communities have exploited
                     the Internet and the Web with extraordinary energy. This religious colonization of cyberspace began first of all as the Internet
                     and the Web afforded safe havens for those otherwise at the margins of North American religious life, e.g., Wiccans, Pagans,
                     New Age seekers, etc., as well as (if more gradually) representatives of the world traditions such as Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism,
                     etc. (<a href="#ss1-2-12_b31">O'Leary and Brasher 1996</a>; <a href="#ss1-2-12_b29">Larsen 2001</a>).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>This enthusiasm was fueled (as elsewhere) by the rise of postmodernism, especially as postmodernism was theoretically conjoined
                     with the technologies of hypertext and then the Web through such theorists as Jay David Bolter and George Landow. As postmodernism
                     made its way into religious scholarship and theology, it was embraced especially by Evangelicals and Pentecostals, as postmodernism
                     promised to unseat modern rationalism – and thus shift epistemological legitimacy and authority to emotive experience (e.g., the <i>feeling</i> of being saved), and undermine rationalist approaches to Scripture such as the historical-critical method, thereby eliminating
                     the chief nemesis of Fundamentalist interpretation. More broadly, this trajectory has led to a number of insightful analyses
                     of the relationship between new media and religion – including texts that both celebrate the media's ostensibly liberatory/revolutionary potentials (e.g., <a href="#ss1-2-12_b12">Careaga 2001</a>) and those that directly challenge postmodernist communication theories by documenting how traditional religious beliefs
                     and assumptions have shaped and constrained the development and use of the new technologies (e.g., <a href="#ss1-2-12_b14">Davis 1998</a>; see <a href="#ss1-2-12_b18">Ess 2001, 2004</a> for an overview of this development and relevant literature).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Currently, the plethora of sites on the Web devoted to religion staggers the imagination: a Google search on "religion", for example, will turn up some 13–8 million hits. As yet, there is no authoritative study of this massive inventory. Two studies in progress suggest, however,
                     an interesting pattern:
                  </p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                     <p><i>Evangelical/Pentecostal/Fundamentalist</i> sites more fully exploit the interactive nature of online communication to proselytize; while sites representing the online
                        "face" of more <i>mainstream</i> and <i>conservative</i> traditions – including the Roman Catholic Church and the Greek Orthodox Church – largely provide extensive databases of authoritative texts and pronouncements, and relatively little interactive opportunity.
                     </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>This pattern, moreover, is consistent with other studies that show, for example, that initial grassroots efforts to exploit
                     the Internet and the Web for political activism are soon squeezed out as extant power centers learn, if somewhat more slowly,
                     how to use the Web and the Net to re-establish their dominance and centrality online. Similarly, more ecumenical proponents
                     of online religion hope that a global Internet may facilitate a global, dialogical culture that fosters the many voices of
                     diverse religious traditions in a new pluralism. But the emerging patterns of use of the Internet, while giving a certain
                     advantage to previously marginalized traditions, rather largely reflect and preserve the existing religious landscape, i.e.,
                     one marked far more often by allegiance to one's own tradition and proselytizing on its behalf.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-12_h11"></a><h2 class="normal">Concluding Remarks</h2>
                  
                  <p>Should this overview be even approximately correct, it is then notable for two reasons. First of all, through the larger perspectives
                     of research (including cross-cultural research) on computer-mediated communication (CMC), this curve from initial enthusiasm
                     to more pedestrian applications fits the larger pattern of development from the 1980s and 1990s to the late 1990s and early
                     noughties (so the British say) – i.e., from the heyday of postmodernism to a "post-post-modern" period that represents more of a hybrid between postmodernism and whatever came before it. Secondly, this pattern suggests
                     that, indeed, the revolution has succeeded in certain remarkable ways – so much so that we no longer regard computer-based resources and tools as "revolutionary", but simply as "normal" elements of our lives – while at the same time, the multiple failures in philosophy and religion to exploit computing technologies have left a significant
                     portion of our work and lives relatively untouched.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In my own case: I still marvel at having nearly instantaneous access to a remarkable library of important texts – both Biblical and philosophical – not only on my desktop computer, but also my palm-held computer, and that I can undertake searches that help me locate a
                     familiar quote, and perhaps uncover new patterns and insights. In these ways, these computer-based resources and tools certainly
                     enhance my scholarship and teaching. At the same time, as a number of contemporary observers of technology caution, the affordances
                     of these technologies – what they make easy for me to do – thereby encourage me to pursue the paths they facilitate, and perhaps thereby discourage other aspects of scholarship and
                     teaching that, as yet unreduced to computational algorithms, remain comparatively more difficult. As well, the very ubiquity
                     and commonplace character of these technologies may discourage us from attending more carefully to whatever more subtle and
                     long-term consequences they may have for us as scholars and as human beings.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>But even these critical reflections, finally, may be an indication of the success and maturity of the computing revolution
                     in philosophy and religion: perhaps like other revolutions we now take for granted, the computing revolution has proceeded
                     far enough along to allow us to critically evaluate both its strengths and its limits.
