                  <p>This collection marks a turning point in the field of digital humanities: for the first time, a wide range of theorists and
                     practitioners, those who have been active in the field for decades, and those recently involved, disciplinary experts, computer
                     scientists, and library and information studies specialists, have been brought together to consider digital humanities as
                     a discipline in its own right, as well as to reflect on how it relates to areas of traditional humanities scholarship.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>This collection has its origins in the research carried out over the past half a century in textually focused computing in
                     the humanities, as Susan Hockey notes in this volume, found in Father Roberto Busa's adaptation of early computing to textual
                     location, comparison, and counting as part of his work in creating the <i>Index Thomisticus</i>, a concordance to the works of St Thomas Aquinas. Yet even a cursory glance at this <i>Companion</i>'s table of contents reveals how broadly the field now defines itself. It remains deeply interested in text, but as advances
                     in technology have made it first possible, then trivial to capture, manipulate, and process other media, the field has redefined
                     itself to embrace the full range of multimedia. Especially since the 1990s, with the advent of the World Wide Web, digital
                     humanities has broadened its reach, yet it has remained in touch with the goals that have animated it from the outset: using
                     information technology to illuminate the human record, and bringing an understanding of the human record to bear on the development
                     and use of information technology.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The first section of the <i>Companion</i> addresses the field of digital humanities from disciplinary perspectives. Although the breadth of fields covered is wide,
                     what is revealed is how computing has cut across disciplines to provide not only tools, but methodological focal points. There
                     is, for example, a shared focus on preserving physical artifacts (written, painted, carved, or otherwise created), that which
                     is left to us by chance (ruin, and other debris of human activity), or that which has been near-impossible to capture in its
                     intended form (music, performance, and event). Yet many disciplines have gone beyond simply wishing to preserve these artifacts,
                     what we might now call early forms of data management, to re-represent and manipulate them to reveal properties and traits
                     not evident when the artifact was in its native form. Moreover, digital humanities now also concerns itself with the creation
                     of new artifacts which are born digital and require rigorous study and understanding in their own right.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Eiteljorg notes that archaeologists, like most other early adopters in the arts and humanities, first used the computer for
                     record making and record keeping, in the knowledge that data in this form would see more flexible utilization, particularly
                     in computer-assisted statistical analysis. More recent applications derive from the introduction of global data-recording
                     standards, allowing large corpora of archaeological data to be navigated, as well as the integration of global information
                     systems (GlS) – derived data to represent standard locational information across these corpora. Art historians, as described by Greenhalgh,
                     use computers to image, order, sort, interrogate, and analyze data about artworks, and increasingly use the Internet as the
                     carrier for multimedia research or teaching/learning projects. Classical studies has always been a data-intensive enterprise, Crane demonstrates, and has seen the development
                     of lexica, encyclopedias, commentaries, critical editions, and other elements of scholarly infrastructure that are well suited
                     to an electronic environment which, ultimately, reflects a natural impulse toward systematic knowledge management and engineering
                     within the field. So, too, is this impulse essential to the understanding of computing's role in literary studies (as noted
                     by Rommel), linguistics (as discussed by Hajic), and lexicography (as charted by Wooldridge). In discussing the discipline
                     of musicology, Fujinaga and Weiss note that the Internet has revolutionized not only the distribution potential for the artifacts
                     that lie at the heart of their consideration but, also, other more analytical applications pertinent to the future of the
                     field. Thomas documents the intense methodological debates sparked by the introduction of computing in history, debates which
                     computing ultimately lost (in the United States, at least), after which it took a generation for historians to reconsider
                     the usefulness of the computer to their discipline. The rhetoric of revolution proved more predictive in other disciplines,
                     though – for example, in philosophy and religion. Today, one hears less and less of it, perhaps because (as Ess notes) the revolution
                     has succeeded: in almost all disciplines, the power of computers, and even their potential, no longer seem revolutionary at
                     all. While this may be true of a number of disciplines, in fields such as the performing arts, as discussed by Saltz, and
                     new media studies, by Rockwell and Mactavish, there is an inherent kinship between the ever-evolving developments in computing
                     and their performative and analytical potentials.

                  <a name="ss1-1-3_h1"></a><h2 class="normal">Principles, Applications, and Dissemination</h2>
                  
                  <p>The digital humanities, then, and their interdisciplinary core found in the field of humanities computing, have a long and
                     dynamic history best illustrated by examination of the locations at which specific disciplinary practices intersect with computation.
                     Even so, just as the various fields that make up the humanities share a focus on the examination of artifactual evidence of
                     that which makes us human, so, too, do these fields share a number of commonly held assumptions about the way in which such
                     examination is carried out, both with and without the assistance of the computer. Widely spread through the digital humanities
                     community is the notion that there is a clear and direct relationship between the interpretative strategies that humanists
                     employ and the tools that facilitate exploration of original artifacts based on those interpretative strategies; or, more
                     simply put, those working in the digital humanities have long held the view that application is as important as theory. Thus,
                     exemplary tasks traditionally associated with humanities computing hold the digital representation of archival materials on
                     a par with analysis or critical inquiry, as well as theories of analysis or critical inquiry originating in the study of those
                     materials. The field also places great importance on the means of disseminating the results of these activities and, as Pitti
                     discusses, recognizes that project conception and management can be as important pragmatic concerns as others which are more
                     traditionally associated with disciplinary pursuits.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The representation of archival material involves the use of computer-assisted means to describe and express print-, visual-,
                     and audio-based material in tagged and searchable electronic form, as discussed by Deegan and Tanner. This representation
                     is a critical and self-conscious activity, from the choice of what to represent to the reproduction of primary materials,
                     for example, in the preparation of an electronic edition or digital facsimile (as discussed by Smith) and the exploration
                     of the relationship between digital surrogates to legacy data (Warwick). Related to the process of representation is the necessity
                     of understanding the tools being used, as Laue outlines, and the implications of decisions that we make in the use of those
                     tools and the impact they have on analytical processes (McGann). The growing field of knowledge representation, which draws
                     on the field of artificial intelligence and seeks to "produce models of human understanding that are tractable to computation" (<a href="#ss1-1-3_b4">Unsworth 2001</a>), provides a lens through which we might understand such implications. This is especially true in issues related to archival
                     representation and textual editing, high-level interpretative theory and criticism, and protocols of knowledge transfer – as modeled with computational techniques (discussed by McCarty), and captured via encoding and classification systems (Renear;
                     Sperberg-McQueen) and represented in data structures (Ramsay), some of which have great impact on the ways in which we associate
                     human information (Ryan) and interpret the ways in which it has influence upon us (Drucker).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In the digital humanities, critical inquiry involves the application of algorithmically facilitated search, retrieval, and
                     critical processes that, originating in humanities-based work, have been demonstrated to have application far beyond. Associated
                     with critical theory, this area is typified by interpretative studies that assist in our intellectual and aesthetic understanding
                     of humanistic works. It also involves the application (and applicability) of critical and interpretative tools and analytic
                     algorithms, as discussed by Bradley, on those artifacts produced through processes associated with archival representation
                     made available via resources associated with processes of publishing and the communication of results. Manifested in the analysis
                     techniques that Burrows and Ide each discuss – and seeing utility in a wide-ranging array of applications, from authorship attribution (Craig) to cognitive stylistics (Lancashire)
                     – the basis of such analysis is the encoded and digitally stored corpora governed by strategies of knowledge representation
                     that, themselves, are capable of possessing what we might term a "poetics" (Winder). So, too, with digital media such as film (Kolker), and with issues of interface and usability that are, as Kirschenbaum
                     discusses, integral to all materials in electronic form and our interaction with them. Further, efforts toward dissemination
                     have their roots, ultimately, in issues related to re-presentation but are themselves manifested in concerns pertinent to
                     the nature of computer-facilitated communities (Willett): preservation in the electronic medium (discussed by Abby Smith),
                     professional electronic publication (treated by Jensen's chapter, and addressed further by Palmer), and the unique array of
                     challenges and opportunities that arise with the emergence of digital libraries, as outlined by Besser.

                  <p>The editors intended this collection to serve as a historical record of the field, capturing a sense of the digital humanities
                     as they have evolved over the past half century, and as they exist at the moment. Yet, if one looks at the issues that lie
                     at the heart of nearly all contributions to this volume, one will see that these contributions reflect a relatively clear
                     view of the future of the digital humanities. In addition to charting areas in which past advances have been made, and in
                     which innovation is currently taking place, this volume reveals that digital humanities is addressing many of the most basic
                     research paradigms and methods in the disciplines, to focus our attention on important questions to be asked and answered,
                     in addition to important new ways of asking and answering that are enabled by our interaction with the computer.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>What this collection also reveals is that there are central concerns among digital humanists which cross disciplinary boundaries.
                     This is nowhere more evident than in the representation of knowledge-bearing artifacts. The process of such representation
                     – especially so when done with the attention to detail and the consistency demanded by the computing environment – requires humanists to make explicit what they know about their material and to understand the ways in which that material
                     exceeds or escapes representation. Ultimately, in computer-assisted analysis of large amounts of material that has been encoded
                     and processed according to a rigorous, well thought-out system of knowledge representation, one is afforded opportunities
                     for perceiving and analyzing patterns, conjunctions, connections, and absences that a human being, unaided by the computer,
                     would not be likely to find.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The process that one goes through in order to develop, apply, and compute these knowledge representations is unlike anything
                     that humanities scholars, outside of philosophy, have ever been required to do. This method, or perhaps we should call it
                     a heuristic, discovers a new horizon for humanities scholarship, a paradigm as powerful as any that has arisen in any humanities
                     discipline in the past – and, indeed, maybe more powerful, because the rigor it requires will bring to our attention undocumented features of our
                     own ideation. Coupled with enormous storage capacity and computational power, this heuristic presents us with patterns and
                     connections in the human record that we would never otherwise have found or examined.
