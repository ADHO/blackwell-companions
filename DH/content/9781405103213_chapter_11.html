                  <p>Computers and the performing arts make strange bedfellows. Theater, dance, and performance art persist as relics of liveness
                     in a media-saturated world. As such, they stand in defiant opposition to the computer's rapacious tendency to translate everything
                     into disembodied digital data. Nonetheless, a number of theorists have posited an inherent kinship between computer technology
                     and the performing arts (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b18">Laurel 1991</a>; <a href="#ss1-2-11_b30">Saltz 1997</a>). While "old" media such as print, film, and television traffic in immaterial representations that can be reproduced endlessly for any
                     number of viewers, the interactivity of "new" media draws them closer to live performance. Every user's interaction with a computer is a unique "performance", and moreover it is one that, like theater, typically involves an element of make-believe. When I throw a computer file in
                     the "trash" or "recycling bin", I behave much like an actor, performing real actions within an imaginary framework. I recognize that the "trash bin" on my screen is no more real than a cardboard dagger used in a play; both are bits of virtual reality. Indeed, theater theorist
                     Antonin Artaud coined the term "virtual reality" to describe the illusory nature of characters and objects in the theater over fifty years before Jaron Lanier first used
                     that term in its computer-related sense (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b1">Artaud 1958</a>: 49).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>It is no wonder, then, that performance scholars and practitioners have looked to digital technology to solve age-old problems
                     in scholarship, pedagogy, and creative practice. This chapter will begin with a review of significant scholarly and pedagogical
                     applications of computers to performance, and then turn to artistic applications.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-11_h0"></a><h2 class="normal">Database Analysis</h2>
                  
                  <p>In 1970, with the number of computers in the world still totaling less than 50,000, Lawrence McNamee touted the potential
                     of computers to aid theater research. The examples that he points to as models for the future now seem mundane: a concordance
                     of Eugene O'Neill's plays and a database of theater dissertations, both published in 1969-Twelve years later, in his Presidential
                     Address to the American Society of Theater Research, Joseph Donohue highlighted the still largely hypothetical opportunities
                     computers offered to theater scholars, emphasizing the ability of computers to order textual data into "clear, pertinent and discrete" patterns (1981: 139). In the 1980s theater historians increasingly turned to computers to help organize and analyze historical
                     data. Edward Mullaly, for example, describes his use of an Apple lie and the database software DB Master to reconstruct the
                     career of a minor nineteenth-century American actor/ manager from newspaper accounts (1987: 62). These early attempts by performance scholars to tap the power of computers relied
                     on computers' ability to crunch textual and numeric data, such as dramatic dialogue, critical texts about performance, names,
                     locations, and dates. Such applications do not tackle challenges specific to the performing arts. Using a computer to analyze
                     a play or a performance event is no different from using it to analyze any other kind of literary work or historical phenomenon.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-11_h1"></a><h2 class="normal">Hypermedia</h2>
                  
                  <p>The performing arts, however, are not exclusively, or even primarily, textual. A work of dance, theater, or performance art
                     is a visual, auditory, and, most of all, corporeal event. Only in the 1980s, when low-cost personal computers acquired the
                     ability to store and manipulate images, sounds, and finally video, did computers begin to offer an effective way to represent
                     the phenomenon of performance. Larry Friedlander's Shakespeare Project anticipated many subsequent applications of digital
                     technology to performance pedagogy. Friedlander began to develop the Shakespeare Project in 1984 using an IBM Info Window
                     system. He adopted HyperCard in 1987 while the software was still in development at Apple. Because personal computers then
                     had very crude graphics capabilities and no video, Friedlander adopted a two-screen solution, with the computer providing
                     random access to media stored on a laserdisk. The laserdisk contained hundreds of still images and, more important, six video
                     segments, including two contrasting filmed versions of one scene each from <i>Hamlet, Macbeth</i>, and <i>King Lear.</i> The Shakespeare Project used this video material in three ways. In a Performance area, students could read the Shakespearean
                     text alongside the video, switch between film versions at any time, jump to any point in the text, and alternate between a
                     film's original audio track and a recording of Friedlander's interpretation of the actors'"subtext." In a Study area, students participated in interactive tutorials covering aspects of Shakespearean performance such as characterization
                     and verse. Finally, in a Notebook area, students could extract digital video excerpts to incorporate into their own essays.
                     In each case, the computer made it possible for students to <i>read a performance</i> almost as closely and flexibly as they could a printed text.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>CD-ROM editions of plays released in the 1990s – most notably the 1994 Voyager edition of <i>Macbeth</i> and the 1997 Annenberg/CPB edition of Ibsen's <i>A Doll's House -</i> incorporate core elements of Friedlander's design, keying the play's script to multiple filmed versions of select scenes.
                     In addition, these CD-ROMs provide a rich assortment of critical resources and still images. The Voyager <i>Macbeth</i> also includes an audio recording of the entire play by the Royal Shakespeare Company and a karaoke feature that allows the
                     user to perform a role opposite the audio. These CD-ROMs take advantage of the ability acquired by personal computers in the
                     1990s to display video directly, obviating the need for a laserdisk player and second monitor. This approach is far more elegant,
                     compact, and cost-efficient than using laserdisks, but the video in these early CD-ROM titles is much smaller and lower in
                     quality than that of a laserdisk. By 2000, faster computer processors and video cards, along with more efficient video compression
                     schemes and widespread DVD technology, had finally closed the gap between personal computers and laserdisk players.

                  <a name="ss1-2-11_h2"></a><h2 class="normal">Theater Models</h2>
                  
                  <p>The projects considered so far rely on the multimedia capabilities of computers; that is, a computer's ability to store and
                     retrieve text, images, and audio. Other projects have exploited the power of computers to generate complex simulations of
                     3-D reality. Performance scholars began to explore the use of 3-D modeling in the mid-1980s to visualize hypotheses about
                     historical theater buildings and staging practices. In 1984, Robert Golder constructed a 3-D computer model of the 1644 Théatre du Marais, and Robert Sarlós used computer models to visualize staging strategies for a real-world recreation of the medieval Passion Play of Lucerne.
                     This technique became more common in the 1990s when high-end computer-assisted design (CAD) software became available for
                     personal computers. Theater historians used 3-D modeling software to reconstruct structures such as the fifth-century bce Theater of Dionysos (Didaskalia website) and Richelieu's Palais Cardinal theater (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b37">Williford 2000</a>). One of the most ambitious of these projects is an international effort, led by Richard Beacham and James Packer, to reconstruct
                     the 55 bce Roman theater of Pompey. The computer model is painstakingly detailed, with every contour of every column and frieze being
                     modeled in three dimensions. As a result, even using state-of-the-art graphics workstations, a single frame takes approximately
                     one hour to render at screen resolution (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b5">Denard 2002</a>: 36).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>None of the 3-D modeling projects described above allow a user to navigate the virtual spaces in real time; the models are
                     experienced only as a series of still images or pre-rendered animations. These projects are geared toward research, with the
                     goal of generating new historical knowledge and testing hypotheses. Consequently, the quality of the data is more important
                     than the experience of the user. When the emphasis is on teaching rather than research, however, the tendency is to make the
                     opposite trade-off, favoring interactivity over detail and precision. The most significant effort along those lines is the
                     THEATRON project, also under the direction of Richard Beacham, with funding from the European Commission. THEATRON uses Virtual
                     Reality Modeling Language (VRML) to allow people to explore models of historically significant theater structures over the
                     Web. The first set of walkthroughs, including such structures as the Ancient Greek theater of Epidauros, Shakespeare's Globe
                     and the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, became commercially available in 2002.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The THEATRON walkthroughs provide an experience of immersion, conveying a clear sense of the scale and configuration of the
                     theater spaces. These spaces, however, are empty and static, devoid of any sign of performance. Frank Mohler, a theater historian
                     and designer, has adopted an approach that focuses not on the architecture <i>per se</i>, but on technologies used for changing scenery. Mohler has made effective use of simple animations to simulate the appearance
                     and functioning of Renaissance and Baroque stage machinery.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-11_h3"></a><h2 class="normal">Performance Simulations</h2>
                  
                  <p>Models of theaters and scenery, no matter how detailed, immersive, or interactive, simulate only the environment within which
                     performances take place. There have also been attempts to use computer animation techniques to simulate the phenomenon of
                     performance itself, both for pedagogical and scholarly purposes. Again, Larry Friedlander produced one of the earliest examples,
                     a program called TheaterGame created in conjunction with the Shakespeare Project. This software was innovative for its time
                     and attracted a good deal of press attention. TheaterGame allowed students to experiment with staging techniques by selecting
                     crude two-dimensional human figures, clothing them from a limited palette of costumes, positioning set pieces on a virtual
                     stage, and finally moving the virtual actors around the stage and positioning their limbs to form simple gestures. The goal
                     was to allow students with no theater experience or access to real actors to investigate the effects of basic staging choices.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>At the same time Friedlander was developing TheaterGame, Tom Calvert began to develop a similar, but vastly more sophisticated,
                     application geared toward choreographers. The project started in the 1970s as a dance notation system called Compose that
                     ran on a mainframe computer and output its data to a line printer. In the 1980s, Calvert replaced abstract symbols describing
                     motions with 3-D human animations and dubbed the new program LifeForms. The human models in LifeForms are featureless wireframes,
                     but the movements are precise, flexible, and anatomically correct. LifeForms was designed as a kind of word processor for
                     dance students and practicing choreographers, a tool for composing dances. In 1990, the renowned choreographer Merce Cunningham
                     adopted the software, bringing it to international attention. In the early 1990s, LifeForms became a commercial product.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Motion capture technology offers a very different approach to performance simulation. Motion capture uses sensors to track
                     a performer's movements in space and then maps those movements onto a computer-generated model. While applications such as
                     Life-Forms are authoring tools for virtual performances, motion capture provides a tool for archiving and analyzing real performances.
                     The Advanced Computer Center for Art and Design (ACCAD) at Ohio State University maintains a high-end optical motion capture
                     system dedicated to research in the performing arts. In 2001, ACCAD began to build an archive of dance and theater motion
                     data by capturing two performances by the legendary mime Marcel Marceau. These data, which include subtle details such as
                     the performer's breathing, can be transferred onto any 3-D model and analyzed in depth.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I am currently working with a team of researchers at seven universities on a National Science Foundation project that combines
                     many elements of the projects discussed above: 3-D modeling of theater architecture, animated scenery, performance simulation
                     using motion capture, along with simulations of audience interactions and hypermedia content. This project, called Virtual
                     Vaudeville, is creating a computer simulation of late nineteenth-century American vaudeville theater. The goal is to develop
                     reusable strategies for using digital technology to reconstruct and archive historical performance events. Virtual Vaudeville
                     strives to produce the sensation of being surrounded by human activity on stage, in the audience, and backstage. Viewers enter
                     the virtual theater and watch the animated performances from any position in the audience, and are able to interact with the
                     animated spectators around them. Professional actors are recreating the stage performances, and these performances are being
                     transferred to 3-D models of the nineteenth-century performers using motion and facial capture technology. The program is
                     being built with a high-performance game engine of the sort usually used to create commercial 3-D action games.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Computer simulations of performance spaces and performers are powerful research and teaching tools, but carry inherent dangers.
                     Performance reconstructions can encourage a positivist conception of history (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b5">Denard 2002</a>: 34). A compelling computer simulation conceals the hypothetical and provisional nature of historical interpretation. Moreover,
                     vividly simulated theaters and performances produce the sensation that the viewer has been transported back in time and is
                     experiencing the performance event "as it really was." But even if all of the physical details of the simulation are accurate, a present-day viewer's experience will be radically
                     different from that of the original audience because the cultural context of its reception has changed radically. Some projects,
                     such as the Pompey Project and Virtual Vaudeville, are making a concerted effort to counteract these positivistic tendencies,
                     primarily by providing hypermedia notes that supply contextual information, provide the historical evidence upon which the
                     reconstructions are based, and offer alternatives to the interpretations of and extrapolations from the historical data used
                     in the simulation. Whether such strategies will prove sufficient remains to be seen.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-11_h4"></a><h2 class="normal">Computers in Performance</h2>
                  
                  <p>My focus so far has been on applications of computers to teaching and research in the performing arts. Digital technology
                     is also beginning to have a significant impact on the way those art forms are being practiced. For example, the computer has
                     become a routine part of the design process for many set and lighting designers. Throughout the 1990s, a growing number of
                     designers adopted CAD software to draft blueprints and light plots and, more recently, employed 3-D modeling software (sometimes
                     integrated into the CAD software) to produce photorealistic visualizations of set and lighting designs.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Computers are also being incorporated into the performances themselves. The earliest and most fully assimilated example is
                     computer-controlled stage lighting. Computerized light boards can store hundreds of light cues for a single performance, automatically
                     adjusting the intensity, and in some cases the color and direction, of hundreds of lighting instruments for each cue. This
                     technology was introduced in the late 1970s, and by the 1990s had become commonplace even in school and community theaters.
                     Similarly, set designers have used computerized motion control systems to change scenery on stage – though this practice is still rare and sometimes has disastrous results. For example, the initial pre-Broadway run of Disney's
                     stage musical <i>Aida</i> featured a six-ton robotic pyramid that changed shape under computer control to accommodate different scenes. The pyramid
                     broke down on opening night and repeatedly thereafter (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b12">Elliott 1998</a>). Disney jettisoned the high-tech set, along with the production's director and designer, before moving the show to Broadway.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Computer-controlled lighting and scenery changes are simply automated forms of pre-computer stage technologies. A growing
                     number of dance and theater artists have incorporated interactive digital media into live performance events. Such performances
                     can have a profound impact on the way the art forms are conceived, collapsing the neat ontological divide that once separated
                     (or seemed to separate) the live performing arts from reproductive media such as film and video. The Digital Performance Archive,
                     a major research project conducted by Nottingham Trent University and the University of Salford, has created a web-based database
                     documenting hundreds of dance and theater performances produced in the 1990s that combined digital media with live performance.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>George Coates's Performance Works in San Francisco was one of the first and most prominent theater companies to combine digital
                     media with live performance to create stunning, poetic visual spectacles. In 1989, George Coates founded SMARTS (Science Meets
                     the Arts), a consortium including companies such as Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, and Apple Computer, to acquire the
                     high-end technology required for his productions. In a series of productions starting with <i>Invisible Site: A Virtual Sbo</i> in 1991, Coates perfected a technique for producing the vivid illusion of live performers fully integrated into a rapidly
                     moving 3-D virtual environment. The spectators wear polarized glasses to view huge, high-intensity stereographic projections
                     of digital animations. The projections that surround the revolving stage cover not only the back wall but the stage floor
                     and transparent black scrims in front of the performers. The digital images are manipulated interactively during the performances
                     to maintain tight synchronization between the live performers and the media.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Another pioneer in the use of virtual scenery is Mark Reaney, founder of the Institute for the Exploration of Virtual Realities
                     (i.e. VR) at the University of Kansas (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b28">Reaney 1996</a>; <a href="#ss1-2-11_b14">Gharavi 1999</a>). In place of physical scenery, Reaney creates navigable 3-D computer models that he projects onto screens behind the performers.
                     The perspective on Reaney's virtual sets changes in relation to the performers' movements, and a computer operator can instantly
                     transform the digital scenery in any way Reaney desires. In 1995, i.e. VR presented its first production, Elmer Rice's expressionist
                     drama <i>The Adding Machine.</i> For this production, Reaney simply rear-projected the virtual scenery. For <i>Wings</i> in 1996, Reaney had the spectators wear low-cost head-mounted displays that allowed them to see stereoscopic virtual scenery
                     and the live actors simultaneously. Starting with <i>Telsa Electric</i> in 1998 Reaney adopted an approach much like Coates's, projecting stereoscopic images for the audience to view through polarized
                     glasses. Nonetheless, Reaney's approach differs from Coates's in a number of important ways. While Coates authors his own
                     highly associative works, Reaney usually selects pre-existing plays with linear narratives. Reaney's designs, while containing
                     stylized elements, are far more literal than Coates's, and the technology he employs, while more advanced than that available
                     to most university theaters, is far more affordable than the state-of-the-art technology at Coates's disposal.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>A number of dance performances have experimented with interactive 3-D technology similar to that used by Coates and Reaney.
                     One of the earliest and most influential examples is <i>Dancing with the Virtual Dervish/Virtual Bodies</i>, a collaboration between dancer and choreographer Yacov Sharir, visual artist Diane Gromala, and architect Marcos Novak first
                     presented at the Banff Center for the Arts in 1994. For this piece, Sharir dons a head-mounted display and enters a VR simulation
                     of the interior of a human body, constructed from MRI images of Gromala's own body. The images that Sharir sees in the display
                     are projected onto a large screen behind him as he dances.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The three examples of digitally-enhanced performance considered above are radically different in their aesthetics and artistic
                     goals, but all establish the same basic relationship between the media and live performers: in each case, the media functions
                     as virtual scenery, in other words, as an environment within which a live performance occurs. There are, however, many other
                     roles that media can assume in a performance<a href="#ss1-2-11_fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>. For example, the media can play a dramatic role, creating virtual characters who interact with the live performers. A number
                     of choreographers, including prominent figures such as Merce Cunningham and Bill T Jones, have enlisted motion capture technology
                     to lend subtle and expressive movements to virtual dance partners (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b8">Dils 2002</a>). Often, as in the case of both Cunningham's and Jones's work, the computer models themselves are highly abstract, focusing
                     the spectators' attention on the motion itself. In a 2000 production of <i>The Tempest</i> at the University of Georgia, the spirit Ariel was a 3-D computer animation controlled in real time by a live performer using
                     motion capture technology (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b32">Saltz 2001b</a>). Claudio Pinhanez has applied artificial intelligence and computer-vision techniques to create fully autonomous computer
                     characters. His two-character play <i>It/I</i>, presented at MIT in 1997, pitted a live actor against a digital character (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b27">Pinhanez and Bobick 2002</a>).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>A key goal of Pinhanez's work is to produce an unmediated interaction between the live performer and digital media. While
                     this goal is unusual in theater, it is becoming increasingly common in dance, where there is less pressure to maintain a coherent
                     narrative, and so creating an effective interaction between the performer and media does not require sophisticated artificial
                     intelligence techniques. Electronic musicians created a set of technologies useful for creating interactive dance in the 1980s
                     in the course of exploring sensors for new musical instrument interfaces. The Studio for Electro-Instrumental Music, or Steim,
                     in the Netherlands was an early center for this research, and continues to facilitate collaborations between dancers and electronic
                     musicians. A number of dancers have created interactive performances using the Very Nervous System (VNS), a system first developed
                     by the Canadian media artist David Rokeby in 1986. The VNS uses video cameras to detect very subtle motions that can trigger
                     sounds or video. One of the first dance companies formed with the explicit goal of combining dance with interactive technology
                     was Troika Ranch, founded in 1993 by Mark Coniglio and Dawn Stoppiello. Troika Ranch has developed a wireless system, MidiDancer,
                     which converts a dancer's movements into MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) data, which can be used to trigger sounds,
                     video sequences, or lighting.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>One of the most complex and successful applications of this kind of sensor technology was the 2001 production <i>L'Universe</i> (pronounced "loony verse") created by the Flying Karamazov Brothers, a troupe of comedic jugglers, in conjunction with Neil Gershenfeld of the Physics
                     and Media Group at MIT. Gershenfeld created special juggling clubs with programmable displays, and used sonar, long-range
                     RF links and computer vision to track the positions and movements of the four performers. This technology was used to create
                     a complex interplay between the performers and media, with the jugglers' actions automatically triggering sounds and altering
                     the color of the clubs.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Brenda Laurel and Rachel Strickland's interactive drama <i>Placeholder</i> is one of the best-known attempts to create a performance in which the spectators interact directly with the technology.
                     As two spectators move through a ten-foot diameter circle wearing head-mounted displays, they interact with a series of digital
                     characters, with a character called the Goddess controlled by a live performer, and, to a limited extent, with each other
                     (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b29">Ryan 1997</a>: 695–6). The challenge of creating a rich and compelling narrative within this kind of interactive, open-ended structure is immense.
                     While a number of writers have tackled this challenge from a theoretical perspective (see, for example, <a href="#ss1-2-11_b29">Ryan 1997</a>; <a href="#ss1-2-11_b26">Murray 1997</a>), the promise of this new dramatic medium remains largely unfulfilled.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <a name="ss1-2-11_h5"></a><h2 class="normal">Telematic Performance</h2>
                  
                  <p>In 1932, in a remarkable anticipation of Internet culture, theater theorist and playwright Bertolt Brecht imagined a future
                     in which radio would cease to be merely a one-way "apparatus for distribution" and become "the finest possible communication apparatus in public life, a vast network of pipes" (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b4">Brecht 1964</a>: 52). By the early 1990s, it had become possible to stream video images over the Internet at very low cost, and performance
                     groups were quick to exploit video streaming technologies to create live multi-site performance events. In a 1994 production
                     of <i>Nowhere Band</i>, George Coates used free CU-SeeMe video-conferencing software to allow three band members at various locations in the Bay
                     Area to perform live with a Bulgarian bagpipe player in Australia for an audience in San Francisco (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b17">Illingworth 1995</a>). In 1995, Cathy Weiss used the same software to create an improvised dance performance at The Kitchen in New York with the
                     real-time participation of a video artist in Prague and a DJ in (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b31">Santa Monica Saltz 2001a</a>). In 1999 the Australian Company in Space created a live duet between a dancer in Arizona and her partner in Australia (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b3">Birringer 1999</a>: 368–9). In 2001, the opera <i>The Technophobe and Madman</i> took advantage of the new high-speed Internet2 network to create a multi-site piece of theater. Half of the performers performed
                     at Rensselaer Polytechnic University, while the other half performed 160 miles away at New York University. Two separate audiences,
                     one at each location, watched the performance simultaneously, each seeing half the performers live and the other half projected
                     on a large projection screen (see <a href="#ss1-2-11_b23">Mirapaul 2001</a>). The Gertrude Stein Repertory Theater (GSRT) is a company dedicated to developing new technologies for creating theater.
                     In their production <i>of The Making of Americans</i> (2003), adapted from Gertrude Stein's novel, performers in remote locations work together in real time to create live performances
                     in both locations simultaneously, with the faces and bodies of actors in one location being projected via videoconferencing
                     on masks and costumes worn by actors in the second location. The GSRT draws a parallel between this process, which they call
                     "Distance Puppetry", and Japanese performance traditions such as <i>bunraku</i> and <i>ningyo buri</i> that also employ multiple performers to portray individual characters.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Telematic performance acquires its greatest impact when spectators interact directly with people at the remote site and experience
                     the uncanny collapse of space first-hand. In the 1990s, new media artist Paul Sermon created a series of interactive art installations
                     joining physically separated viewers. For example, in <i>Telematic Dreaming</i> a viewer lies down on one side of a bed and on the other side sees a real-time video projection of a participant lying down
                     on a second, identical bed in a remote location. Other installations place the remote participants on a couch, around a dining
                     room table and at a seance table (<a href="#ss1-2-11_b3">Birringer 1999</a>: 374). A more provocative example of a performance event that joins a live performer to the Internet is Stelarc's 1996 <i>Ping Body: An Internet Actuated and Uploaded Performance</i>, in which a muscle stimulator sent electric charges of 0–60 volts into Stelarc to trigger involuntary movements in his arms and legs proportionate to the ebb and flow of Internet
                     activity.

                  <p>The use of computers in the performing arts does not merely add a new tool to an old discipline. It challenges some of our
                     most basic assumptions about performance. First, it blurs the boundaries between performance disciplines. When we watch a
                     performer automatically triggering recorded fragments of dialogue as she moves across a stage, are we witnessing a piece of
                     music, dance, or theater? Second, it blurs the boundaries between scholarship and creative practice. Is someone who extrapolates a complete set design,
                     script, and performance from shreds of historical evidence to create a virtual performance simulation an artist or a scholar? When someone develops new artificial intelligence algorithms in order to create a dramatic interaction between a digital
                     character and a live actor, is that person functioning as a computer scientist or an artist whose medium just happens to be
                     computers? Finally, digital technology is challenging the very distinction between "liveness" and media. When a live performer interacts with a computer-generated animation, is the animation "live"? Does the answer depend on whether the animation was rendered in advance or is being controlled in real time via motion capture
                     or with artificial intelligence software? Or do we now live in a world, as performance theorist Philip Auslander suggests, where the concept of liveness is losing
                     its meaning?
